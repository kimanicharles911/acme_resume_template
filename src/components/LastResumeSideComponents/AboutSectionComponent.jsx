      <hr />
      <p>I'm a Nyeri, Kenya based Software Engineer looking for a job. I take part in serving my Nation ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª and the World for them to have top-scale software that entirely fulfills their goals and makes life blissful. You can jump to the projects section and see solutions that I have made. In 2020 I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Business Information Technology from Dedan Kimathi University. As I look for a job I am a FullStack Web Development Student at The HyperionDev bootcamp learning MongoDB, Expressjs, Reactjs, Nextjs and Nodejs.</p>
